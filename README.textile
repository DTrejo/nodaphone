h1. "Nodaphone":http://github.com/dtrejo/nodaphone

See the demo at "nodaphone.dtrejo.com":http://nodaphone.dtrejo.com/
There's also some basic documentation over there. 

Let me know if I should add more, or if it is unclear. Thanks!


h2. Getting started

"Install node.js and npm":http://joyeur.com/2010/12/10/installing-node-and-npm/

Then clone the git repo like this, install the dependencies, and start up the demo:
<pre>cd nodaphone/
git submodule update --init --recursive
npm install eyes socket.io node-static
node nodaphone.js</pre>

(I may have forgotten a dependency, in which case you will need to <code>npm install</code> it.)

Crazy props to these technologies and individuals for making this possible:
